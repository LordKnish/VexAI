## Pregenerated Flags
You can see folders called "Americas flags" and "European Union Country Flags" These are folders filled with flags that were generated by me for Reddits r/vexiology. You can see the posts for the Americas [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/qt1li5/ai_generated_flags_of_countries_in_the_americas/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and for the European Union Countries [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/qpclv3/eu_countries_flags_generated_by_an_ai/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

## Installation instructions
1. Download the zip of the github archive and unzip it to a folder that does not require admin perms to modify
2. Pip install the requirements.txt file (pip install -r requirements.txt)
3. Add your API key to the script
